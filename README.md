**Recipe Ideas App**

**Overview**

Recipe Ideas App is a web application built using React that helps users discover and explore recipes from around the world.
The app fetches recipe data from TheMealDB API and displays a list of recipes with images, names, and ingredients.
Users can search recipes by name and view detailed cooking instructions.

This project was developed as part of the Take-Home Challenge to demonstrate skills in frontend development, problem-solving, and API integration.

**Features**
Recipe Search – Users can search for any recipe by entering keywords (for example, “chicken”, “pasta”).

Dynamic Results – Recipes are fetched from TheMealDB API and displayed dynamically.

Recipe Cards – Each recipe card shows an image, title, and short description.

Detailed View – Clicking a recipe shows detailed information including category, origin, ingredients, and cooking instructions.

Responsive Design – Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Error Handling – Displays a friendly message when no recipes are found.

Loading Indicator – Shows a loader while data is being fetched.

**Assessment Focus**

This app was built to meet the challenge requirements:

Understanding and implementing user requirements

Designing a user-friendly interface

Using React and plain CSS for UI development

Handling API data effectively

Maintaining clean and readable code structure

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
